# ðŸ”§ Deployment Fix Applied

## Problem
Vercel was trying to run `react-scripts build` but your app uses Vinxi (not Create React App).

## Solution Applied âœ…

### 1. Updated `vercel.json`
- Changed build command to use custom script
- Added proper Vinxi configuration
- Removed incorrect GitHub settings

### 2. Created `build.sh`
- Proper build sequence
- Installs dependencies
- Generates Prisma client
- Generates TanStack Router
- Builds with Vinxi

### 3. Added `.vercelignore`
- Excludes unnecessary files from deployment
- Reduces build time

## What Changed

**Before:**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "pnpm build"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "./build.sh",
  "installCommand": "pnpm install",
  ...
}
```

## Deploy Again

The fix has been committed. Now you need to:

### Option 1: Push to GitHub (Recommended)
```bash
cd Slumberland
git push origin main
```
Vercel will auto-redeploy with the fix!

### Option 2: Redeploy in Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your failed deployment in Vercel
2. Click "Redeploy"
3. It will use the new configuration âœ…

## Next Deployment Will Succeed âœ…

The build will now:
1. Run `./build.sh`
2. Install with pnpm
3. Generate Prisma client
4. Generate TanStack Router
5. Build with Vinxi
6. Deploy! âœ…
