# ðŸš€ Push Slumberland to GitHub - Step by Step

## Option 1: Quick Push (Recommended)

## Option 2: Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repo First

1. Visit: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `Slumberland`  
3. Description: "Dream journal with 12 agentic gods"
4. Choose Public or Private
5. **Don't check** "Initialize with README"
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Your Code

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
# Go to Slumberland directory
cd "/Users/aaj2127/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Code/Slumberland"

git remote add origin https://github.com/aaj2127/Slumberland.git

# Push to GitHub!
