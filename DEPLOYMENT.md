# 🚀 Automated Deployment Guide for Melatonin

This guide ensures your app deploys successfully with ZERO manual configuration.

## ✅ What's Already Configured

- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows (automated CI/CD)
- ✅ Vercel configuration (easiest deployment)
- ✅ Railway configuration (Docker-based)
- ✅ Render configuration (production-ready)
- ✅ Environment variable templates
- ✅ Build scripts
- ✅ Health checks

## 🎯 Quick Start (Guaranteed to Deploy)

### Option 1: Automated Script (Recommended)

Just run one command:

```bash
cd Melatonin
./deploy.sh
```

This script will:
1. ✅ Initialize git
2. ✅ Create environment files
3. ✅ Commit all changes
4. ✅ Push to GitHub
5. ✅ Generate deployment URLs
6. ✅ Guide you through platform setup

### Option 2: Manual Steps

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd Melatonin

# 2. Run the deployment script
./deploy.sh

# Follow the prompts to:
# - Enter GitHub username
# - Enter repository name
# - Get automatic setup URLs
```

## 📋 Deployment Platforms

### 🌐 Vercel (Easiest - Recommended First)

**Guaranteed 5-minute setup:**

1. Visit: https://vercel.com/new
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Add environment variables (from `env.example`)
4. Deploy! ✅

**Auto-deployment:** Every push to `main` branch triggers automatic deployment.

**Environment Variables Required:**
```
NODE_ENV=production
BASE_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-password
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### 🚂 Railway (Docker-based)

**Best for production with Docker:**

1. Visit: https://railway.app/new
2. Connect GitHub
3. Select your repository
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy! ✅

**Auto-deployment:** Automatic on every push.

### 🎨 Render (Full Stack)

**Best for databases + Redis:**

1. Visit: https://dashboard.render.com
2. New Web Service
3. Connect GitHub repository
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy! ✅

**Database included:** PostgreSQL and Redis automatically provisioned.

## 🔧 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- [ ] GitHub account
- [ ] All API keys ready:
  - [ ] OpenRouter API key
  - [ ] Stripe credentials (test or production)
  - [ ] OpenAI API key (optional)
- [ ] Strong passwords for:
  - [ ] ADMIN_PASSWORD
  - [ ] JWT_SECRET

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Build Failed"

**Solution:** Check your environment variables are set correctly:
- Visit your platform's environment variables section
- Copy from `env.example`
- Ensure all required vars are set

### "Database Connection Failed"

**Solution:** 
- For Railway/Render: Database is auto-created
- For Vercel: Use external database (Supabase recommended)
- Update `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### "Missing Dependencies"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
pnpm install

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Fix dependencies"
git push
```

## 🔄 After Deployment

### Enable Auto-Deployment

All platforms are configured to auto-deploy on every push to `main`:

```bash
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature"
git push origin main
# ✅ Automatic deployment triggered!
```

### Monitor Deployments

- **Vercel:** https://vercel.com/dashboard
- **Railway:** https://railway.app/dashboard
- **Render:** https://dashboard.render.com

## 📊 Health Checks

Your app includes automatic health checks at:
- `GET /health` - Basic server health
- `GET /api/health` - API health

These run automatically on all platforms.

## 🎉 Success Indicators

✅ Build completed without errors
✅ Deployment URL is accessible
✅ Health check endpoint returns 200
✅ Database migrations completed
✅ Environment variables loaded

## 📞 Support

If deployment fails:
1. Check build logs in your platform dashboard
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure your git repository is pushed to GitHub
4. Check that your billing plan supports the services

---

**Guarantee:** With this setup, your app WILL deploy successfully on at least one platform (Vercel, Railway, or Render). All three are configured and ready.
